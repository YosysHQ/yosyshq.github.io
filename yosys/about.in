<h1>About</h1>

<p>Yosys is a framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It currently has
extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of
synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Selected features
and typical applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Process almost any synthesizable Verilog-2005 design
<li>Converting Verilog to BLIF / EDIF/ BTOR / SMT-LIB / simple RTL Verilog / etc.
<li>Built-in formal methods for checking properties and equivalence
<li>Mapping to ASIC standard cell libraries (in Liberty File Format)
<li>Mapping to Xilinx 7-Series and Lattice iCE40 FPGAs
<li>Foundation and/or front-end for custom flows
</ul>

<p>Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining
the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and
adding additional passes as needed by extending the Yosys C++
code base.</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<p>Yosys is controlled using synthesis scripts. For example, the following
Yosys synthesis script reads a design (with the top module <tt>mytop</tt>) from
the verilog file <tt>mydesign.v</tt>, synthesizes it to a gate-level netlist
using the cell library in the Liberty file <tt>mycells.lib</tt> and writes the
synthesized results as Verilog netlist to <tt>synth.v</tt>:</p>

<pre># read design 
read_verilog mydesign.v

# elaborate design hierarchy
hierarchy -check -top mytop

# the high-level stuff
proc; opt; fsm; opt; memory; opt

# mapping to internal cell library
techmap; opt

# mapping flip-flops to mycells.lib
dfflibmap -liberty mycells.lib

# mapping logic to mycells.lib
abc -liberty mycells.lib

# cleanup
clean

# write synthesized design
write_verilog synth.v</pre>

<p>The <tt>synth</tt> command provides a good default script that can be used
as basis for simple synthesis scripts:</p>

<pre># read design 
read_verilog mydesign.v

# generic synthesis
synth -top mytop

# mapping to mycells.lib
dfflibmap -liberty mycells.lib
abc -liberty mycells.lib
clean

# write synthesized design
write_verilog synth.v</pre>
