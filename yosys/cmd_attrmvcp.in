<h1>attrmvcp - move or copy attributes from wires to driving cells</h1>
<pre>
    attrmvcp [options] [selection]

Move or copy attributes on wires to the cells driving them.

    -copy
        By default, attributes are moved. This will only add
        the attribute to the cell, without removing it from
        the wire.

    -purge
        If no selected cell consumes the attribute, then it is
        left on the wire by default. This option will cause the
        attribute to be removed from the wire, even if no selected
        cell takes it.

    -driven
        By default, attriburtes are moved to the cell driving the
        wire. With this option set it will be moved to the cell
        driven by the wire instead.

    -attr &lt;attrname&gt;
        Move or copy this attribute. This option can be used
        multiple times.
