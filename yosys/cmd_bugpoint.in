<h1>bugpoint - minimize testcases</h1>
<pre>
    bugpoint [options]

This command minimizes testcases that crash Yosys. It removes an arbitrary part
of the design and recursively invokes Yosys with a given script, repeating these
steps while it can find a smaller design that still causes a crash. Once this
command finishes, it replaces the current design with the smallest testcase it
was able to produce.

It is possible to specify the kinds of design part that will be removed. If none
are specified, all parts of design will be removed.

    -yosys &lt;filename&gt;
        use this Yosys binary. if not specified, `yosys` is used.

    -script &lt;filename&gt;
        use this script to crash Yosys. required.

    -grep &lt;string&gt;
        only consider crashes that place this string in the log file.

    -fast
        run `clean -purge` after each minimization step. converges faster, but
        produces larger testcases, and may fail to produce any testcase at all if
        the crash is related to dangling wires.

    -clean
        run `clean -purge` before checking testcase and after finishing. produces
        smaller and more useful testcases, but may fail to produce any testcase
        at all if the crash is related to dangling wires.

    -modules
        try to remove modules.

    -ports
        try to remove module ports.

    -cells
        try to remove cells.

    -connections
        try to reconnect ports to 'x.
