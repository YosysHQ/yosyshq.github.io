<h1>chformal - change formal constraints of the design</h1>
<pre>
    chformal [types] [mode] [options] [selection]

Make changes to the formal constraints of the design. The [types] options
the type of constraint to operate on. If none of the following options are given,
the command will operate on all constraint types:

    -assert       $assert cells, representing assert(...) constraints
    -assume       $assume cells, representing assume(...) constraints
    -live         $live cells, representing assert(s_eventually ...)
    -fair         $fair cells, representing assume(s_eventually ...)
    -cover        $cover cells, representing cover() statements

Exactly one of the following modes must be specified:

    -remove
        remove the cells and thus constraints from the design

    -early
        bypass FFs that only delay the activation of a constraint

    -delay &lt;N&gt;
        delay activation of the constraint by &lt;N&gt; clock cycles

    -skip &lt;N&gt;
        ignore activation of the constraint in the first &lt;N&gt; clock cycles

    -assert2assume
    -assume2assert
    -live2fair
    -fair2live
        change the roles of cells as indicated. these options can be combined
