<pre>
    dfflibmap [-prepare] -liberty &lt;file&gt; [selection]

Map internal flip-flop cells to the flip-flop cells in the technology
library specified in the given liberty file.

This pass may add inverters as needed. Therefore it is recommended to
first run this pass and then map the logic paths to the target technology.

When called with -prepare, this command will convert the internal FF cells
to the internal cell types that best match the cells found in the given
liberty file.
