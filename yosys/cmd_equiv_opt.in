<h1>equiv_opt - prove equivalence for optimized circuit</h1>
<pre>
    equiv_opt [options] [command]

This command uses temporal induction to check circuit equivalence before and
after an optimization pass.

    -run &lt;from_label&gt;:&lt;to_label&gt;
        only run the commands between the labels (see below). an empty
        from label is synonymous to the start of the command list, and empty to
        label is synonymous to the end of the command list.

    -map &lt;filename&gt;
        expand the modules in this file before proving equivalence. this is
        useful for handling architecture-specific primitives.

    -blacklist &lt;file&gt;
        Do not match cells or signals that match the names in the file
        (passed to equiv_make).

    -assert
        produce an error if the circuits are not equivalent.

    -multiclock
        run clk2fflogic before equivalence checking.

    -async2sync
        run async2sync before equivalence checking.

    -undef
        enable modelling of undef states during equiv_induct.

The following commands are executed by this verification command:

    run_pass:
        hierarchy -auto-top
        design -save preopt
        [command]
        design -stash postopt

    prepare:
        design -copy-from preopt  -as gold A:top
        design -copy-from postopt -as gate A:top

    techmap:    (only with -map)
        techmap -wb -D EQUIV -autoproc -map &lt;filename&gt; ...

    prove:
        clk2fflogic    (only with -multiclock)
        async2sync     (only with -async2sync)
        equiv_make -blacklist &lt;filename&gt; ... gold gate equiv
        equiv_induct [-undef] equiv
        equiv_status [-assert] equiv

    restore:
        design -load preopt
