<h1>equiv_struct - structural equivalence checking</h1>
<pre>
    equiv_struct [options] [selection]

This command adds additional $equiv cells based on the assumption that the
gold and gate circuit are structurally equivalent. Note that this can introduce
bad $equiv cells in cases where the netlists are not structurally equivalent,
for example when analyzing circuits with cells with commutative inputs. This
command will also de-duplicate gates.

    -fwd
        by default this command performans forward sweeps until nothing can
        be merged by forwards sweeps, then backward sweeps until forward
        sweeps are effective again. with this option set only forward sweeps
        are performed.

    -fwonly &lt;cell_type&gt;
        add the specified cell type to the list of cell types that are only
        merged in forward sweeps and never in backward sweeps. $equiv is in
        this list automatically.

    -icells
        by default, the internal RTL and gate cell types are ignored. add
        this option to also process those cell types with this command.

    -maxiter &lt;N&gt;
        maximum number of iterations to run before aborting
