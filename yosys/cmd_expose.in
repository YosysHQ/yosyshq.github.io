<h1>expose - convert internal signals to module ports</h1>
<pre>
    expose [options] [selection]

This command exposes all selected internal signals of a module as additional
outputs.

    -dff
        only consider wires that are directly driven by register cell.

    -cut
        when exposing a wire, create an input/output pair and cut the internal
        signal path at that wire.

    -input
        when exposing a wire, create an input port and disconnect the internal
        driver.

    -shared
        only expose those signals that are shared among the selected modules.
        this is useful for preparing modules for equivalence checking.

    -evert
        also turn connections to instances of other modules to additional
        inputs and outputs and remove the module instances.

    -evert-dff
        turn flip-flops to sets of inputs and outputs.

    -sep &lt;separator&gt;
        when creating new wire/port names, the original object name is suffixed
        with this separator (default: '.') and the port name or a type
        designator for the exposed signal.
