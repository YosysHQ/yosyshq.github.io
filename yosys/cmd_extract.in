<h1>extract - find subcircuits and replace them with cells</h1>

    extract -map &lt;map_file&gt; [options] [selection]
    extract -mine &lt;out_file&gt; [options] [selection]

This pass looks for subcircuits that are isomorphic to any of the modules
in the given map file and replaces them with instances of this modules. The
map file can be a Verilog source file (*.v) or an ilang file (*.il).

    -map &lt;map_file&gt;
        use the modules in this file as reference. This option can be used
        multiple times.

    -map %&lt;design-name&gt;
        use the modules in this in-memory design as reference. This option can
        be used multiple times.

    -verbose
        print debug output while analyzing

    -constports
        also find instances with constant drivers. this may be much
        slower than the normal operation.

    -nodefaultswaps
        normally builtin port swapping rules for internal cells are used per
        default. This turns that off, so e.g. 'a^b' does not match 'b^a'
        when this option is used.

    -compat &lt;needle_type&gt; &lt;haystack_type&gt;
        Per default, the cells in the map file (needle) must have the
        type as the cells in the active design (haystack). This option
        can be used to register additional pairs of types that should
        match. This option can be used multiple times.

    -swap &lt;needle_type&gt; &lt;port1&gt;,&lt;port2&gt;[,...]
        Register a set of swappable ports for a needle cell type.
        This option can be used multiple times.

    -perm &lt;needle_type&gt; &lt;port1&gt;,&lt;port2&gt;[,...] &lt;portA&gt;,&lt;portB&gt;[,...]
        Register a valid permutation of swappable ports for a needle
        cell type. This option can be used multiple times.

    -cell_attr &lt;attribute_name&gt;
        Attributes on cells with the given name must match.

    -wire_attr &lt;attribute_name&gt;
        Attributes on wires with the given name must match.

    -ignore_parameters
        Do not use parameters when matching cells.

    -ignore_param &lt;cell_type&gt; &lt;parameter_name&gt;
        Do not use this parameter when matching cells.

This pass does not operate on modules with unprocessed processes in it.
(I.e. the 'proc' pass should be used first to convert processes to netlists.)

This pass can also be used for mining for frequent subcircuits. In this mode
the following options are to be used instead of the -map option.

    -mine &lt;out_file&gt;
        mine for frequent subcircuits and write them to the given ilang file

    -mine_cells_span &lt;min&gt; &lt;max&gt;
        only mine for subcircuits with the specified number of cells
        default value: 3 5

    -mine_min_freq &lt;num&gt;
        only mine for subcircuits with at least the specified number of matches
        default value: 10

    -mine_limit_matches_per_module &lt;num&gt;
        when calculating the number of matches for a subcircuit, don't count
        more than the specified number of matches per module

    -mine_max_fanout &lt;num&gt;
        don't consider internal signals with more than &lt;num&gt; connections

The modules in the map file may have the attribute 'extract_order' set to an
integer value. Then this value is used to determine the order in which the pass
tries to map the modules to the design (ascending, default value is 0).

See 'help techmap' for a pass that does the opposite thing.
