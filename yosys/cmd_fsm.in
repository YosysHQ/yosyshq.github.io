<h1>fsm - extract and optimize finite state machines</h1>
<pre>
    fsm [options] [selection]

This pass calls all the other fsm_* passes in a useful order. This performs
FSM extraction and optimization. It also calls opt_clean as needed:

    fsm_detect          unless got option -nodetect
    fsm_extract

    fsm_opt
    opt_clean
    fsm_opt

    fsm_expand          if got option -expand
    opt_clean           if got option -expand
    fsm_opt             if got option -expand

    fsm_recode          unless got option -norecode

    fsm_info

    fsm_export          if got option -export
    fsm_map             unless got option -nomap

Options:

    -expand, -norecode, -export, -nomap
        enable or disable passes as indicated above

    -fullexpand
        call expand with -full option

    -encoding type
    -fm_set_fsm_file file
    -encfile file
        passed through to fsm_recode pass
