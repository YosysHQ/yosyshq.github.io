    fsm_detect [selection]

This pass detects finite state machines by identifying the state signal.
The state signal is then marked by setting the attribute 'fsm_encoding'
on the state signal to "auto".

Existing 'fsm_encoding' attributes are not changed by this pass.

Signals can be protected from being detected by this pass by setting the
'fsm_encoding' attribute to "none".
