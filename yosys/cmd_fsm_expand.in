<h1>fsm_expand - expand FSM cells by merging logic into it</h1>
<pre>
    fsm_expand [-full] [selection]

The fsm_extract pass is conservative about the cells that belong to a finite
state machine. This pass can be used to merge additional auxiliary gates into
the finite state machine.

By default, fsm_expand is still a bit conservative regarding merging larger
word-wide cells. Call with -full to consider all cells for merging.
