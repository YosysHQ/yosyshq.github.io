<h1>fsm_export - exporting FSMs to KISS2 files</h1>
<pre>
    fsm_export [-noauto] [-o filename] [-origenc] [selection]

This pass creates a KISS2 file for every selected FSM. For FSMs with the
'fsm_export' attribute set, the attribute value is used as filename, otherwise
the module and cell name is used as filename. If the parameter '-o' is given,
the first exported FSM is written to the specified filename. This overwrites
the setting as specified with the 'fsm_export' attribute. All other FSMs are
exported to the default name as mentioned above.

    -noauto
        only export FSMs that have the 'fsm_export' attribute set

    -o filename
        filename of the first exported FSM

    -origenc
        use binary state encoding as state names instead of s0, s1, ...
