    ice40_wrapcarry [selection]

Wrap manually instantiated SB_CARRY cells, along with their associated SB_LUT4s,
into an internal $__ICE40_CARRY_WRAPPER cell for preservation across technology
mapping.

Attributes on both cells will have their names prefixed with 'SB_CARRY.' or
'SB_LUT4.' and attached to the wrapping cell.
A (* keep *) attribute on either cell will be logically OR-ed together.

    -unwrap
        unwrap $__ICE40_CARRY_WRAPPER cells back into SB_CARRYs and SB_LUT4s,
        including restoring their attributes.
