<h1>iopadmap - technology mapping of i/o pads (or buffers)</h1>
<pre>
    iopadmap [options] [selection]

Map module inputs/outputs to PAD cells from a library. This pass
can only map to very simple PAD cells. Use 'techmap' to further map
the resulting cells to more sophisticated PAD cells.

    -inpad &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;in_port&gt;[:&lt;ext_port&gt;]
        Map module input ports to the given cell type with the
        given output port name. if a 2nd portname is given, the
        signal is passed through the pad call, using the 2nd
        portname as the port facing the module port.

    -outpad &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;out_port&gt;[:&lt;ext_port&gt;]
    -inoutpad &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;io_port&gt;[:&lt;ext_port&gt;]
        Similar to -inpad, but for output and inout ports.

    -toutpad &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;oe_port&gt;:&lt;out_port&gt;[:&lt;ext_port&gt;]
        Merges $_TBUF_ cells into the output pad cell. This takes precedence
        over the other -outpad cell. The first portname is the enable input
        of the tristate driver, which can be prefixed with `~` for negative
        polarity enable.

    -tinoutpad &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;oe_port&gt;:&lt;in_port&gt;:&lt;out_port&gt;[:&lt;ext_port&gt;]
        Merges $_TBUF_ cells into the inout pad cell. This takes precedence
        over the other -inoutpad cell. The first portname is the enable input
        of the tristate driver and the 2nd portname is the internal output
        buffering the external signal.  Like with `-toutpad`, the enable can
        be marked as negative polarity by prefixing the name with `~`.

    -ignore &lt;celltype&gt; &lt;portname&gt;[:&lt;portname&gt;]*
        Skips mapping inputs/outputs that are already connected to given
        ports of the given cell.  Can be used multiple times.  This is in
        addition to the cells specified as mapping targets.

    -widthparam &lt;param_name&gt;
        Use the specified parameter name to set the port width.

    -nameparam &lt;param_name&gt;
        Use the specified parameter to set the port name.

    -bits
        create individual bit-wide buffers even for ports that
        are wider. (the default behavior is to create word-wide
        buffers using -widthparam to set the word size on the cell.)

Tristate PADS (-toutpad, -tinoutpad) always operate in -bits mode.
