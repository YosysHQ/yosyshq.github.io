    log string

Print the given string to the screen and/or the log file. This is useful for TCL
scripts, because the TCL command "puts" only goes to stdout but not to
logfiles.

    -stdout
        Print the output to stdout too. This is useful when all Yosys is executed
        with a script and the -q (quiet operation) argument to notify the user.

    -stderr
        Print the output to stderr too.

    -nolog
        Don't use the internal log() command. Use either -stdout or -stderr,
        otherwise no output will be generated at all.

    -n
        do not append a newline
