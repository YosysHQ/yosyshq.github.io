    logger [options]

This command sets global logger properties, also available using command line
options.

    -[no]time
        enable/disable display of timestamp in log output.

    -[no]stderr
        enable/disable logging errors to stderr.

    -warn regex
        print a warning for all log messages matching the regex.

    -nowarn regex
        if a warning message matches the regex, it is printed as regular
        message instead.

    -werror regex
        if a warning message matches the regex, it is printed as error
        message instead and the tool terminates with a nonzero return code.

    -[no]debug
        globally enable/disable debug log messages.

    -experimental &lt;feature&gt;
        do not print warnings for the specified experimental feature

    -expect &lt;type&gt; &lt;regex&gt; &lt;expected_count&gt;
        expect log, warning or error to appear. matched errors will terminate
        with exit code 0.

    -expect-no-warnings
        gives error in case there is at least one warning that is not expected.

    -check-expected
        verifies that the patterns previously set up by -expect have actually
        been met, then clears the expected log list.  If this is not called
        manually, the check will happen at yosys exist time instead.
