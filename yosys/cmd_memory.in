<h1>memory - translate memories to basic cells</h1>
<pre>
    memory [-nomap] [-nordff] [-memx] [-bram &lt;bram_rules&gt;] [selection]

This pass calls all the other memory_* passes in a useful order:

    memory_dff [-nordff]                (-memx implies -nordff)
    opt_clean
    memory_share
    opt_clean
    memory_memx                         (when called with -memx)
    memory_collect
    memory_bram -rules &lt;bram_rules&gt;     (when called with -bram)
    memory_map                          (skipped if called with -nomap)

This converts memories to word-wide DFFs and address decoders
or multiport memory blocks if called with the -nomap option.
