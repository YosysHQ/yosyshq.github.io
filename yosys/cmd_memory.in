    memory [-nomap] [-nordff] [-nowiden] [-nosat] [-memx] [-bram &lt;bram_rules&gt;] [selection]

This pass calls all the other memory_* passes in a useful order:

    opt_mem
    opt_mem_priority
    opt_mem_feedback
    memory_dff                          (skipped if called with -nordff or -memx)
    opt_clean
    memory_share [-nowiden] [-nosat]
    opt_mem_widen
    memory_memx                         (when called with -memx)
    opt_clean
    memory_collect
    memory_bram -rules &lt;bram_rules&gt;     (when called with -bram)
    memory_map                          (skipped if called with -nomap)

This converts memories to word-wide DFFs and address decoders
or multiport memory blocks if called with the -nomap option.
