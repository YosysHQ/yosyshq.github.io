<h1>memory_share - consolidate memory ports</h1>
<pre>
    memory_share [-nosat] [-nowiden] [selection]

This pass merges share-able memory ports into single memory ports.

The following methods are used to consolidate the number of memory ports:

  - When multiple write ports access the same address then this is converted
    to a single write port with a more complex data and/or enable logic path.

  - When multiple read or write ports access adjacent aligned addresses, they are
    merged to a single wide read or write port.  This transformation can be
    disabled with the "-nowiden" option.

  - When multiple write ports are never accessed at the same time (a SAT
    solver is used to determine this), then the ports are merged into a single
    write port.  This transformation can be disabled with the "-nosat" option.

Note that in addition to the algorithms implemented in this pass, the $memrd
and $memwr cells are also subject to generic resource sharing passes (and other
optimizations) such as "share" and "opt_merge".
