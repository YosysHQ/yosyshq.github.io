<h1>memory_share - consolidate memory ports</h1>
<pre>
    memory_share [selection]

This pass merges share-able memory ports into single memory ports.

The following methods are used to consolidate the number of memory ports:

  - When write ports are connected to async read ports accessing the same
    address, then this feedback path is converted to a write port with
    byte/part enable signals.

  - When multiple write ports access the same address then this is converted
    to a single write port with a more complex data and/or enable logic path.

  - When multiple write ports are never accessed at the same time (a SAT
    solver is used to determine this), then the ports are merged into a single
    write port.

Note that in addition to the algorithms implemented in this pass, the $memrd
and $memwr cells are also subject to generic resource sharing passes (and other
optimizations) such as "share" and "opt_merge".
