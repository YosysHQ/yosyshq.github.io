<h1>muxcover - cover trees of MUX cells with wider MUXes</h1>
<pre>
    muxcover [options] [selection]

Cover trees of $_MUX_ cells with $_MUX{4,8,16}_ cells

    -mux4[=cost], -mux8[=cost], -mux16[=cost]
        Use the specified types of MUXes (with optional integer costs). If none
        of these options are given, the effect is the same as if all of them are.
        Default costs: $_MUX_ = 100, $_MUX4_ = 220,
                       $_MUX8_ = 460, $_MUX16_ = 940

    -dmux=cost
        Use the specified cost for $_MUX_ cells used in decoders.
        Default cost: 90

    -nodecode
        Do not insert decoder logic. This reduces the number of possible
        substitutions, but guarantees that the resulting circuit is not
        less efficient than the original circuit.

    -nopartial
        Do not consider mappings that use $_MUX&lt;N&gt;_ to select from less
        than &lt;N&gt; different signals.
