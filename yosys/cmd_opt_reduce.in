    opt_reduce [options] [selection]

This pass performs two interlinked optimizations:

1. it consolidates trees of large AND gates or OR gates and eliminates
duplicated inputs.

2. it identifies duplicated inputs to MUXes and replaces them with a single
input with the original control signals OR'ed together.
