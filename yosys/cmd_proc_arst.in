<h1>proc_arst - detect asynchronous resets</h1>
<pre>
    proc_arst [-global_arst [!]&lt;netname&gt;] [selection]

This pass identifies asynchronous resets in the processes and converts them
to a different internal representation that is suitable for generating
flip-flop cells with asynchronous resets.

    -global_arst [!]&lt;netname&gt;
        In modules that have a net with the given name, use this net as async
        reset for registers that have been assign initial values in their
        declaration ('reg foobar = constant_value;'). Use the '!' modifier for
        active low reset signals. Note: the frontend stores the default value
        in the 'init' attribute on the net.
