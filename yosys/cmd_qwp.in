<h1>qwp - quadratic wirelength placer</h1>
<pre>
    qwp [options] [selection]

This command runs quadratic wirelength placement on the selected modules and
annotates the cells in the design with 'qwp_position' attributes.

    -ltr
        Add left-to-right constraints: constrain all inputs on the left border
        outputs to the right border.

    -alpha
        Add constraints for inputs/outputs to be placed in alphanumerical
        order along the y-axis (top-to-bottom).

    -grid N
        Number of grid divisions in x- and y-direction. (default=16)

    -dump &lt;html_file_name&gt;
        Dump a protocol of the placement algorithm to the html file.

    -v
        Verbose solver output for profiling or debugging

Note: This implementation of a quadratic wirelength placer uses exact
dense matrix operations. It is only a toy-placer for small circuits.
