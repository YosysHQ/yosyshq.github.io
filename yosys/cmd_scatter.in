<h1>scatter - add additional intermediate nets</h1>
<pre>
    scatter [selection]

This command adds additional intermediate nets on all cell ports. This is used
for testing the correct use of the SigMap helper in passes. If you don't know
what this means: don't worry -- you only need this pass when testing your own
extensions to Yosys.

Use the opt_clean command to get rid of the additional nets.
