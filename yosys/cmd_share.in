<h1>share - perform sat-based resource sharing</h1>
<pre>
    share [options] [selection]

This pass merges shareable resources into a single resource. A SAT solver
is used to determine if two resources are share-able.

  -force
    Per default the selection of cells that is considered for sharing is
    narrowed using a list of cell types. With this option all selected
    cells are considered for resource sharing.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: If the -all option is used then no cells with internal
    state must be selected!

  -aggressive
    Per default some heuristics are used to reduce the number of cells
    considered for resource sharing to only large resources. This options
    turns this heuristics off, resulting in much more cells being considered
    for resource sharing.

  -fast
    Only consider the simple part of the control logic in SAT solving, resulting
    in much easier SAT problems at the cost of maybe missing some opportunities
    for resource sharing.

  -limit N
    Only perform the first N merges, then stop. This is useful for debugging.
