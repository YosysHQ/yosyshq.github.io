<h1>show - generate schematics using graphviz</h1>
<pre>
    show [options] [selection]

Create a graphviz DOT file for the selected part of the design and compile it
to a graphics file (usually SVG or PostScript).

    -viewer &lt;viewer&gt;
        Run the specified command with the graphics file as parameter.
        On Windows, this pauses yosys until the viewer exits.

    -format &lt;format&gt;
        Generate a graphics file in the specified format. Use 'dot' to just
        generate a .dot file, or other &lt;format&gt; strings such as 'svg' or 'ps'
        to generate files in other formats (this calls the 'dot' command).

    -lib &lt;verilog_or_rtlil_file&gt;
        Use the specified library file for determining whether cell ports are
        inputs or outputs. This option can be used multiple times to specify
        more than one library.

        note: in most cases it is better to load the library before calling
        show with 'read_verilog -lib &lt;filename&gt;'. it is also possible to
        load liberty files with 'read_liberty -lib &lt;filename&gt;'.

    -prefix &lt;prefix&gt;
        generate &lt;prefix&gt;.* instead of ~/.yosys_show.*

    -color &lt;color&gt; &lt;object&gt;
        assign the specified color to the specified object. The object can be
        a single selection wildcard expressions or a saved set of objects in
        the @&lt;name&gt; syntax (see "help select" for details).

    -label &lt;text&gt; &lt;object&gt;
        assign the specified label text to the specified object. The object can
        be a single selection wildcard expressions or a saved set of objects in
        the @&lt;name&gt; syntax (see "help select" for details).

    -colors &lt;seed&gt;
        Randomly assign colors to the wires. The integer argument is the seed
        for the random number generator. Change the seed value if the colored
        graph still is ambiguous. A seed of zero deactivates the coloring.

    -colorattr &lt;attribute_name&gt;
        Use the specified attribute to assign colors. A unique color is
        assigned to each unique value of this attribute.

    -width
        annotate buses with a label indicating the width of the bus.

    -signed
        mark ports (A, B) that are declared as signed (using the [AB]_SIGNED
        cell parameter) with an asterisk next to the port name.

    -stretch
        stretch the graph so all inputs are on the left side and all outputs
        (including inout ports) are on the right side.

    -pause
        wait for the user to press enter to before returning

    -enum
        enumerate objects with internal ($-prefixed) names

    -long
        do not abbreviate objects with internal ($-prefixed) names

    -notitle
        do not add the module name as graph title to the dot file

    -nobg
        don't run viewer in the background, IE wait for the viewer tool to
        exit before returning

When no &lt;format&gt; is specified, 'dot' is used. When no &lt;format&gt; and &lt;viewer&gt; is
specified, 'xdot' is used to display the schematic (POSIX systems only).

The generated output files are '~/.yosys_show.dot' and '~/.yosys_show.&lt;format&gt;',
unless another prefix is specified using -prefix &lt;prefix&gt;.

Yosys on Windows and YosysJS use different defaults: The output is written
to 'show.dot' in the current directory and new viewer is launched each time
the 'show' command is executed.
