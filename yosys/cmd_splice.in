<h1>splice - create explicit splicing cells</h1>
<pre>
    splice [options] [selection]

This command adds $slice and $concat cells to the design to make the splicing
of multi-bit signals explicit. This for example is useful for coarse grain
synthesis, where dedicated hardware is needed to splice signals.

    -sel_by_cell
        only select the cell ports to rewire by the cell. if the selection
        contains a cell, than all cell inputs are rewired, if necessary.

    -sel_by_wire
        only select the cell ports to rewire by the wire. if the selection
        contains a wire, than all cell ports driven by this wire are wired,
        if necessary.

    -sel_any_bit
        it is sufficient if the driver of any bit of a cell port is selected.
        by default all bits must be selected.

    -wires
        also add $slice and $concat cells to drive otherwise unused wires.

    -no_outputs
        do not rewire selected module outputs.

    -port &lt;name&gt;
        only rewire cell ports with the specified name. can be used multiple
        times. implies -no_output.

    -no_port &lt;name&gt;
        do not rewire cell ports with the specified name. can be used multiple
        times. can not be combined with -port &lt;name&gt;.

By default selected output wires and all cell ports of selected cells driven
by selected wires are rewired.
