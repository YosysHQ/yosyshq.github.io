<h1>splitnets - split up multi-bit nets</h1>
<pre>
    splitnets [options] [selection]

This command splits multi-bit nets into single-bit nets.

    -format char1[char2[char3]]
        the first char is inserted between the net name and the bit index, the
        second char is appended to the netname. e.g. -format () creates net
        names like 'mysignal(42)'. the 3rd character is the range separation
        character when creating multi-bit wires. the default is '[]:'.

    -ports
        also split module ports. per default only internal signals are split.

    -driver
        don't blindly split nets in individual bits. instead look at the driver
        and split nets so that no driver drives only part of a net.
