<h1>submod - moving part of a module to a new submodule</h1>
<pre>
    submod [-copy] [selection]

This pass identifies all cells with the 'submod' attribute and moves them to
a newly created module. The value of the attribute is used as name for the
cell that replaces the group of cells with the same attribute value.

This pass can be used to create a design hierarchy in flat design. This can
be useful for analyzing or reverse-engineering a design.

This pass only operates on completely selected modules with no processes
or memories.


    submod -name &lt;name&gt; [-copy] [selection]

As above, but don't use the 'submod' attribute but instead use the selection.
Only objects from one module might be selected. The value of the -name option
is used as the value of the 'submod' attribute above.

By default the cells are 'moved' from the source module and the source module
will use an instance of the new module after this command is finished. Call
with -copy to not modify the source module.
