<h1>wreduce - reduce the word size of operations if possible</h1>
<pre>
    wreduce [options] [selection]

This command reduces the word size of operations. For example it will replace
the 32 bit adders in the following code with adders of more appropriate widths:

    module test(input [3:0] a, b, c, output [7:0] y);
        assign y = a + b + c + 1;
    endmodule

Options:

    -memx
        Do not change the width of memory address ports. Use this options in
        flows that use the 'memory_memx' pass.

    -keepdc
        Do not optimize explicit don't-care values.
