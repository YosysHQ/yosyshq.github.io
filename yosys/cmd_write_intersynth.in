<h1>write_intersynth - write design to InterSynth netlist file</h1>
<pre>
    write_intersynth [options] [filename]

Write the current design to an 'intersynth' netlist file. InterSynth is
a tool for Coarse-Grain Example-Driven Interconnect Synthesis.

    -notypes
        do not generate celltypes and conntypes commands. i.e. just output
        the netlists. this is used for postsilicon synthesis.

    -lib &lt;verilog_or_ilang_file&gt;
        Use the specified library file for determining whether cell ports are
        inputs or outputs. This option can be used multiple times to specify
        more than one library.

    -selected
        only write selected modules. modules must be selected entirely or
        not at all.
