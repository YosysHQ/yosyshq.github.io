<h1>write_verilog - write design to Verilog file</h1>
<pre>
    write_verilog [options] [filename]

Write the current design to a Verilog file.

    -sv
        with this option, SystemVerilog constructs like always_comb are used

    -norename
        without this option all internal object names (the ones with a dollar
        instead of a backslash prefix) are changed to short names in the
        format '_&lt;number&gt;_'.

    -renameprefix &lt;prefix&gt;
        insert this prefix in front of auto-generated instance names

    -noattr
        with this option no attributes are included in the output

    -attr2comment
        with this option attributes are included as comments in the output

    -noexpr
        without this option all internal cells are converted to Verilog
        expressions.

    -siminit
        add initial statements with hierarchical refs to initialize FFs when
        in -noexpr mode.

    -nodec
        32-bit constant values are by default dumped as decimal numbers,
        not bit pattern. This option deactivates this feature and instead
        will write out all constants in binary.

    -decimal
        dump 32-bit constants in decimal and without size and radix

    -nohex
        constant values that are compatible with hex output are usually
        dumped as hex values. This option deactivates this feature and
        instead will write out all constants in binary.

    -nostr
        Parameters and attributes that are specified as strings in the
        original input will be output as strings by this back-end. This
        deactivates this feature and instead will write string constants
        as binary numbers.

    -simple-lhs
        Connection assignments with simple left hand side without concatenations.

    -extmem
        instead of initializing memories using assignments to individual
        elements, use the '$readmemh' function to read initialization data
        from a file. This data is written to a file named by appending
        a sequential index to the Verilog filename and replacing the extension
        with '.mem', e.g. 'write_verilog -extmem foo.v' writes 'foo-1.mem',
        'foo-2.mem' and so on.

    -defparam
        use 'defparam' statements instead of the Verilog-2001 syntax for
        cell parameters.

    -blackboxes
        usually modules with the 'blackbox' attribute are ignored. with
        this option set only the modules with the 'blackbox' attribute
        are written to the output file.

    -selected
        only write selected modules. modules must be selected entirely or
        not at all.

    -v
        verbose output (print new names of all renamed wires and cells)

Note that RTLIL processes can't always be mapped directly to Verilog
always blocks. This frontend should only be used to export an RTLIL
netlist, i.e. after the "proc" pass has been used to convert all
processes to logic networks and registers. A warning is generated when
this command is called on a design with RTLIL processes.
