<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>1. How to report bugs and request support?</h2>

<p>If possible, do not mail the author directly with bug reports or support
questions. Instead, post them on <a
href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/new">GitHub</a>, <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/yosys/">Yosys Subreddit</a>, or <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yosys">Stack Overflow</a>, so
others can profit from your question and the posted answers as well.</p>

<p>A good bug report contains a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal,
complete, and verifiable code example</a> that demonstrates the
problem you are running into. Complete means not just a code snippet, but an
entire top verilog module that can be synthesized. Also include the yosys
script or command line. If your problem is with one of the flows (e.g.  the
open source IceStorm flow), also include scripts or command line for the other
tools in the flow and auxiliary files needed to reporduce the problem (such as
placement constraint files used for place and route). It should be possible to
reproduce the problem you are seeing within seconds using the information you
provided! Every file of line of code someone trying to reproduce your problem
has to write themself will increase the effort someome has to put into
reproducing your problem and at the same time will decrease the chances of
your problem being reproduced correctly!</p>

<p><b>Always consider that someone reading your bug report only
has the information you provided.</b> Before clicking the send button on your bug
report and/or support request, double check that you have provided all the
information necessary to easily and quickly reproduce the problem you are seeing.</p>

<h2>2. What synthesis targets are supported by Yosys?</h2>

<p>Yosys is retargetable and adding support for additional targets is not very
hard. At the moment, Yosys ships with support for ASIC synthesis (from liberty
cell library files), iCE40 FPGAs, Xilinx 7-Series FPGAs, Silego GreenPAK4 devices,
and Gowinsemi GW1N/GW2A FPGAs.</p>

<p>Note that in all this cases Yosys only performs synthesis. For a complete
open source ASIC flow using Yosys see <a href="http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/">Qflow</a>,
for a complete open source iCE40 flow see <a
href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/">Project IceStorm</a>. Yosys
Xilinx 7-Series synthesis output can be placed and routed with Xilinx Vivado.</p>

<h2>3. Does Yosys support timing driven synthesis?</h2>

<p>In general no.</p>

<p>For ASIC synthesis there is timing driven logic optimization
and technology mapping available via ABC: See options <tt>-constr</tt> and
<tt>-D</tt> to the <tt>abc</tt> command (<tt>help abc</tt>). This options
will also make ABC generate a post-synthesis timing report.</p>

<p>For iCE40 synthesis there is timing analysis available via the <tt>icetime</tt>
program that is bundled with the IceStorm tools.</p>

<h2>4. Does Yosys support multi-output cells (e.g. full adders)?</h2>

<p>Multi-output logic cells are simply ignored by ABC at the moment. However,
it is possible to write dedicated mapping rules for things like adders, that
simply map arithmetic operations in the design to e.g. full-adder cells. See
e.g. inference of <tt>SB_CARRY+SB_LUT</tt> blocks for arithmetic operations in
the iCE40 flow.</p>

<p>There is limited support for FFs with non-inverted and inverted outputs in
Yosys and there are plans to further improve support for this cells in the near
future.</p>

<h2>5. The Verilog front-end does not create nice errors for invalid code!</h2>

<p>Not really a question, but yes, this is correct. The focus so far for
development of the Yosys Verilog front-end was on features and processing valid
input, not good error reporting for invalid code. In some cases it will even
accept invalid code! Use a simulatior (such as <a
href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">Icarus Verilog</a> or <a
href="http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>) to check your code
for syntax errors and similar problems. Verilator even has a
<tt>--lint-only</tt> mode for just checking code without compiling it.</p>

<p>On a side note: I usually get this question from people who do not simulate
their designs. Don't be this person! Regardless of what tools you are using,
you should always simulate your designs first before going into synthesis!</p>
